# README.md for Justin Kim

Hi, my name is Justin Kim, and this is my simple README.md file. I haven't used markdown that much, so I'll be playing around with some of the different styles.

But for now, here's a link to my [Python script]!
[Python script]: https://github.com/justinjkim/Disable-Volumes/blob/master/close_vols.py

I like Python:

```Python
hello = "hello world"
print hello
```
